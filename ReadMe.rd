This is a way for you to convert your Throne Room Cards into a format that is easy to filter and search.

The format you should use to create your data is as follows:

Simple Table of Resistance +0

Faction: druid
Quality: Simple
Type: table
Level: 0
Might: 0

30.00% Food Production
-2.00% Life Debuff
-10.00% Combat Speed Debuff
2.00% Range
-5.00% Range Debuff
This is the format KoC Throne Room Organizer Script uses (when copied from the Organize Tab). Spacing does not matter, just have the data separated by lines. Each card should be 11 lines.
